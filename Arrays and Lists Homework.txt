Arrays and Lists Homework
Arrays are considered more efficient if you have a fixed set of items in a list. If you would like to have the opportunity to flexibly resize the list than a list is what you’ll want. It allows for resizing when the program is running. Arrays use square brackets with each item starting at the number 0 (not the number 1!). Lists use carrot brackets where it states what item type the list will house. You can also use lists and arrays together. Within a list you can have an array using the AddRange function. You can use multiple lists to help organize things as well, for instance food groups or warm/cool colors.
